/**
 * Merges controlled and uncontrolled state into a single `[value, setValue]`
 * tuple, mirroring the pattern Radix and Base UI use internally.
 *
 * `onValueChange` fires synchronously in both modes. Functional updates are
 * safe in both modes: they resolve against an eagerly-advanced ref, so
 * multiple `setValue` calls in one event tick compose. `setValue` is
 * referentially stable across renders.
 *
 * The ref re-syncs from the prop at the next commit — but only if one happens.
 * Known constraint: a controlled parent that ignores `onValueChange` AND never
 * re-renders leaves the ref advanced past the real value, and a repeat
 * `setValue` to that same value early-returns at the `Object.is` check without
 * re-notifying. Acceptable — a controlled parent that never commits is already
 * outside the controlled contract — but it is the first thing to check when a
 * controlled value appears stuck.
